# sequelizedBurger - Burger-App

Burger Time is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour` button. When the button is clicked, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize.
